    Ex-marketer taking the path to the dark side... and loving it! 💻 
    <br/>
  <br/>
   I am currently looking for a junior position/internship as a Fullstack JS developer, starting October '20 and preferably in Paris (just sayin'!).
    <br/>
  <br/>
    Interested in building both frontend and backend web-apps, mainly with React/NodeJS but I'm eager to learn 📖! At the moment my projects go from building a new todoList app to learn Redux to an "HR-tech" side-project with some devs friends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
    I'm also fond of anime (go check "Vinland saga" if you haven't), I love French & Italian food 🧀 🍝 🍷  and I (really) hate coriander which is basically my kryptonite...
</p>
